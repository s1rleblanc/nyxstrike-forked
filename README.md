# NyxStrike — macOS Compatibility Fork

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **This is an independent macOS-focused fork of [NyxStrike](https://github.com/CommonHuman-Lab/nyxstrike), the original project by CommonHuman-Lab.**
>
> The purpose of this fork is to help the original project run reliably on macOS, including Intel Macs, while keeping its existing workflow. Compatibility fixes are being proposed upstream. This is not the official repository; credit for NyxStrike and its original design belongs to the upstream authors and contributors.
>
> **macOS support is still being tested.** Some tools need Linux or a newer macOS release. A complete installation on Intel/macOS 12 has not yet been verified.

# NyxStrike

### AI-powered offensive security orchestration engine

</div>

## What is NyxStrike?

NyxStrike connects LLM agents to real offensive security tools and executes full attack chains — from recon to exploitation.

**200+ tools · 50+ categories · AI decision engine · Tamper-evident evidence chain**

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (Installation)

> Get a full offensive security environment running in minutes.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/s1rleblanc/nyxstrike-forked.git
cd nyxstrike-forked

./nyxstrike.sh -a               # Setup + start server
./nyxstrike.sh -a -t            # + install external tools

```

### macOS: Apple Silicon and Intel

The launcher and Python lockfile include support for `arm64` and `x86_64` macOS.
The shell scripts work with macOS's bundled Bash 3.2. A complete tool installation
on Intel/macOS 12 still needs verification; individual tools may require newer
macOS releases or features available only on Linux.

Install Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`, if missing) and
[Homebrew](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation) before setup. Homebrew's
[support tiers](https://docs.brew.sh/Support-Tiers) affect which packages have
prebuilt binaries and which need a source build.

| Mac architecture | Homebrew prefix | Terminal / Python architecture |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Apple Silicon | `/opt/homebrew` | `arm64` (native terminal) |
| Intel | `/usr/local` | `x86_64` |

Keep Homebrew and Python on the same architecture. Create `nyxstrike-env` on each
Mac rather than copying it between machines. Setup uses the same command on both:

```bash
./nyxstrike.sh -a -t
```

To select Python explicitly, append `-p 3.12` or pass a Python executable to `-p`.
Without it, the launcher uses `python3`.

The macOS installer uses a shared tool catalog and checks existing installations
before deciding whether to repair them. Managed commands take precedence in the
launcher's PATH, and tools with conflicting dependencies use separate runtimes
where needed. Re-running the setup command retries failed installations. Details
are written to `install_log.txt`.

A few platform differences matter:

- On Intel, the launcher prepares Rust 1.91 or newer and OpenSSL for the locked
  cryptography and angr source builds. An explicit `OPENSSL_DIR` is respected.
  The angr build also gets the C++ header it needs with Apple's compiler.
- BBOT uses Homebrew on macOS. Wfuzz, WhatWeb, WAFW00F, Sublist3r and several other
  tools use managed runtimes under `~/.local/share/nyxstrike-tools`. Additional
  Python tools cannot replace packages already installed in the server environment;
  unresolved dependency conflicts are reported as failures.
- The catalog installs `kube-bench` through Homebrew, but installing its CLI does
  not provide a Linux Kubernetes host to audit. `docker-bench-security` and other
  tools without a suitable macOS backend are reported as unsupported.
- GDB is built from source; on Apple Silicon, it targets x86_64 Darwin. Attaching
  to macOS processes still requires appropriate code signing. LLDB remains an
  option for native Apple Silicon debugging.

See [macOS installation notes](MACOS_INSTALLATION_CHANGES.md) for the tool-specific
recipes and verification limits. The offline installer tests simulate package
managers and failure cases; they do not establish that every external tool builds
or runs on either architecture.

### Verify Setup

Open [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888) to access the dashboard.

> Some tools (e.g. `nmap`, `masscan`) require elevated privileges for specific scan modes. Use a dedicated test VM and least-privilege setup where possible.

## ⚠️ Security Considerations

> NyxStrike gives AI agents direct access to offensive security tooling.

- Run only in isolated environments or dedicated security testing VMs  
- AI agents may execute real commands — maintain operator oversight  
- Monitor activity via dashboard and logs in real time  
- Use `NYXSTRIKE_API_TOKEN` for any non-local deployment
